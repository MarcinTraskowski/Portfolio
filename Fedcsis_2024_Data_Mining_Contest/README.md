This is my solution for Fedcsis 2024 Data Mining Competition (https://knowledgepit.ai/fedcsis-2024-challenge/), which won special award for the highest cummulative performance.

Full code generating my solution is in Competition_Code.ipynb. I attempted to add short comments there; a more detailed explanations can be found in the paper "Forecasting Stock Trends with Feedforward Neural Networks," which is can be found in below links:
